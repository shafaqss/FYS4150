# FYS4150 - Computational Physics

This repository contains my coursework that I have done in the course FYS4150. I have taken this course in 2020 at University of Oslo. This is a project based course, and there are five projects that must be completed. The five projects are:

* **Project** 1 : Poisson's Equation in One Dimension
* **Project** 2 : Eigenvalue Problems, from the Equations of a Buckling Beam to Schroedinger's Equation for Two Electrons
* **Project** 3 : Modelling the Solar System with Ordinary Differential Equations
* **Project** 4 : Ising Model
* **Project** 5 : The Diffusion Equation in One and Two Dimensions
